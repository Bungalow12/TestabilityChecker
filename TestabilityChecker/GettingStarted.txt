This document is going to obviously cover how to get started with using this TypeScript based Chrome Extension project.

Requirements:
	TypeScript compiler: http://www.typescriptlang.org
	Google Chrome: http://www.google.com/chrome

Nice to haves:
	Visual Studio 2013 with TypeScript extension.

This project is being developed in Visual Studio because it really nicely supports TypeScript with intellisense and other fun things.
You however can write this in any text editor of choice and use the Node.js based typescript compiler. The only thing that matters is the folder structure.

How tos:
	Installing the extension:
		1. Open Chrome
		2. Navigate to chrome://extensions
		3. Check the Developer Mode box
		4. Point to the app folder in this structure
		5. Enjoy

	Debugging the extension:
		1. Install the extension or reload to pull in the changes
		2. Use the Chrome Developer tools
